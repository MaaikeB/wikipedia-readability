# Wikipedia Article Readability


## Description

This app shows Wikipedia articles in a certain category, while giving a certain score for the readability.
The user enters a category, for example 'physics' and a list of articles in that category will be presented.
The list will be sorted by readability - from least readable to most readable.

Readibility can be defined in a number of ways, this App uses the Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability test,
